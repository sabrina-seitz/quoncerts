      <h1>I ❤ Rue Royale</h1>
      <h2>And their fantabulous Quoncerts</h2>

      <p>
        First they fell in love, then the magic happened: The married couple
        Ruth and Brooklyn Dekker started to make music under the name Rue Royale
        in 2006. Since then, the Anglo-American indie folk band has been touring
        both sides of the ocean all the way up and down. In 2020, when the world
        came to a halt due to the Coronavirus, they started playing so called
        <em><span style="color: #5ebec7">Quoncerts</span> </em> to share their
        music with the world and their self-isolated audience.

        The result is 101 live recorded songs (plus three encores) full of
        melancholy and hope, sung by a two voice choir: A three minute remote
        concert paired with daily reflections, laughs and conversations,
        recorded morning after morning during lockdown. So snuggle up on the
        couch and enjoy these snippets of joy and thoughtfulness. #hopeoverfear
